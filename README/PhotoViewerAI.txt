Create a photo gallery UI written in .NET C# razor to add to a blazor .net core website.

The image thumbnails should all be square with rounded edges.
Clicking on a thumbnail should open a modal.
I would like image navigation within the modal using arrows.
Clicking outside the modal should close the modal.
There should be an X in the top left of the modal to close it.
I would like lazy loading for the thumbails if they extend beyond the page limits.

I would like the thumbnails rendered with masonry.js.
