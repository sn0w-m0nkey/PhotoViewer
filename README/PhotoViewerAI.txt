RAZOR

Create a photo gallery UI written in C# razor to add to a blazor .NET core website.

Clicking on a thumbnail should open a modal which displays the image in the correct proportions.
The modal should have image navigation using arrows.
Clicking outside the modal should close the modal.
There should be an X in the top right of the modal to close it.

The image thumbnails should all be square with rounded corners.
Lazy loading should be used for the thumbnails.
